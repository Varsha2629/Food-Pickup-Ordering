## Food Ordering Pick-up

A food ordering app designed for a single restaurant as part of the Lighthouse Labs midterm evaluations. This app allows customers to visit the restaurants' website, order one or more items and receive a SMS notification directly to their phone number when their order is ready for pick-up. The restaurant also receives an SMS notification when the customer makes an order and restaurant is able to specify how long the order will take. This app serves as an intermediary between the customer and the client.

- Twillio was used as the messaging service to implement SMS communication between the client and the restaurant
- The Back-end was developed using SQL, Node.js and Express
- The Front-end was developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap

## Getting Started

1. Create the .env by using .env.example as a reference: cp .env.example .env
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: labber 
  - password: labber 
  - database: midterm
3. Install dependencies: npm i
4. Fix to binaries for sass: npm rebuild node-sass
5. Reset database: npm run db:reset
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: npm run local
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit http://localhost:8080/

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the layout.css file directly, it is auto-generated by layout.scss
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with users.js and widgets.js
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See db folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the npm run db:reset command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to DROP the tables and recreate them.
